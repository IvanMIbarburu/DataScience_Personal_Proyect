# Real Estate Price Predictor
## DataScience_Personal_Proyect

This is my first homemade Data Science project on my own. Please read this note.

## Motivation:
Recently, my father inherited an apartment from a relative in Puente de Vallecas. After thinking about it, he decided he wanted to sell it to a family and reached out to a couple of real estate agencies. When he told me about it, I asked him if he had any idea how much the apartment was worth, and he said he had no clue. That’s why, in a couple of days, he was planning to meet with the real estate agents. So, to give him a preliminary estimate for those meetings, I decided to do some research on my own and come up with a number.

In this repository, you’ll find the steps I followed for this project in different Notebooks:
1. Web scraping of the two real estate websites to gather the data they offer.
2. Data cleaning of all the collected data.
3. Exploratory data analysis to better understand the information.
4. Predictive model to estimate the price of the apartment we’re interested in.
   
Additionally, I’ve included my first Streamlit application with the predictive model and a few extra features. It’s very simple and minimalistic, but it’s functional. In the future, I’d like to learn more and improve it. Here’s the link:

The rest of the repository files consist of PNG images, Excel files with the data I used in the analysis, the predictive model (as .pkl) and the code of the Streamlit app.

Honestly, I believe the value of this project lies in the first three steps, as the predictive model is quite simple. That being said, this project had two goals: to estimate the price of my father’s apartment and to learn how to program each of these steps. I believe I’ve achieved both.

### Important Note:
Personally, I really enjoy using Plotly Express for visualizations because they are highly interactive. However, it’s possible that they won’t look as good on GitHub. If that’s the case, simply download the Jupyter Notebook and run it on your computer.
